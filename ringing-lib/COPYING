However, some of the core files from the Ringing Class Library are licenced 
under the less restrictive terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License
(see COPYING.LGPL for the terms of this).  These files are all clearly 
marked.

The purpose of this is to allow the parts of the Ringing Class Library needed
to read XML method libraries to be linked into commercial applications 
without placing any restrictions on the licence used in such applications 
as a whole.

At the time of writing the following files, all in the ringing/ subdirectory,
are licenced under the LGPL:
